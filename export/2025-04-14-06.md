- **Abstrat**: The possible existence of axions in the universe introduces the intriguing possibility of photon-axion conversion in strong magnetic fields, particularly near compact objects like supermassive black holes or even naked singularity. In this study, we investigate the conversion of photons into axions in the vicinity of a Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetime, a well-known naked singularity solution. Our analysis reveals that photons can efficiently convert into axions with masses less than $100 \rm \ neV$. We calculate the conversion probability and find that it is significantly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the JNW spacetime. The potential observational signatures of this conversion, would be the dimming of photon ring in the X-ray and gamma-ray spectrum. Our findings suggest that compact objects like M87* could be prime candidates for detecting photon-axion conversion effects, provided future advances in high-resolution observations.

## CO Emission and Absorption-line Survey of the M87 Nucleus Using Archival ALMA Imaging
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03249v1
- **Authors**: ['Benjamin D. Boizelle', 'Xueyi Li', 'Nicholas LeVar', 'Sam Norcross', 'Benjamin J. Derieg', 'Jared R. Davidson', 'Kavin Siaw', 'Jonelle L. Walsh']
- **Abstrat**: We present an M87 molecular line search from archival Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) imaging, covering the circumnuclear disk (CND) as well as ionized gas filaments and dusty cloud regions. We find no evidence for CO emission in the central ~kpc and place an upper limit of $M_{H_2} < 2.3\times 10^5$ $M_\odot$ in the atomic gas CND, a factor of 20$\times$ lower than previous surveys. During this search, we discovered extragalactic CO absorption lines in the J = 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 transitions against the bright (Jy-scale) active nucleus. These CO lines are narrow (~5 km s$^{-1}$) and blueshifted with respect to the galaxy's systemic velocity by -75 to -84 km s$^{-1}$. This CO absorber appears to be kinematically distinct from outflowing atomic gas seen in absorption. Assuming a diffuse molecular phase, low integrated opacities ranging from $\tau_{CO} \sim 0.02-0.06$ km s$^{-1}$ and column density $N_{CO} = 1.16\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ translate to $N_{H_2} \sim (1-2) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$. CO excitation temperatures spanning $T_{ex} \sim 8$ K to ~30 K do not follow local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) expectations, and non-LTE radex radiative transfer modeling suggests the CO absorber has a number density $n_{H_2} \sim 5000$ cm$^{-3}$. Taken together, the observed CO absorption lines are most consistent with a thin, pressure-confined filament seen slightly off-center from the M87 nucleus. We also use these ALMA data to explore the impact of residual telluric lines and atmospheric variability on the identification and classification of narrow extragalactic lines. Additionally, we demonstrate how bandpass calibration limitations may introduce broad but very low S/N absorption and emission signatures near such a bright continuum source.

## Survey of Radiative, Two-Temperature Magnetically Arrested Simulations of the Black Hole M87* I: Turbulent Electron Heating
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12448v3
- **Authors**: ['Andrew Chael']
- **Abstrat**: We present a set of eleven two-temperature, radiative, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (2TGRRMHD) simulations of the black hole M87* in the magnetically arrested (MAD) state, surveying different values of the black hole spin $a_*$. Our 3D simulations self-consistently evolve the temperatures of separate electron and ion populations under the effects of adiabatic compression/expansion, viscous heating, Coulomb coupling, and synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton radiation. We adopt a sub-grid heating prescription from gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence. Our simulations have accretion rates $\dot{M}=(0.5-1.5)\times10^{-6}\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ and radiative efficiencies $\epsilon_{\rm rad}=3-35\%$. We compare our simulations to a fiducial set of otherwise identical single-fluid GRMHD simulations and find no significant changes in the outflow efficiency or black hole spindown parameter. Our simulations produce an effective adiabatic index for the two-temperature plasma of $\Gamma_{\rm gas}\approx1.55$, larger than the $\Gamma_{\rm gas}=13/9$ value often adopted in single-fluid GRMHD simulations. We find moderate ion-to-electron temperature ratios in the 230 GHz emitting region of $R=T_{\rm i}/T_{\rm e}{\approx}5$. While total intensity 230 GHz images from our simulations are consistent with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results, our images have significantly more beam-scale linear polarization ($\langle|m|\rangle\approx 30\%$) than is observed in EHT images of M87* ($\langle|m|\rangle<10\%$). We find a trend of the average linear polarization pitch angle $\angle\beta_2$ with black hole spin consistent with what is seen in single-fluid GRMHD simulations, and we provide a simple fitting function for $\angle\beta_2(a_*)$ motivated by the wind-up of magnetic field lines by black hole spin in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.

## A Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) XVIII. Reconstructing the star formation history of early-type galaxies through the combination of their UV and H$α$ emission

- **Abstrat**: We reconstruct the SFHs of 7 massive ($M_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Virgo cluster by analysing their spatially resolved stellar population (SP), including their UV and H$\alpha$ emission. As part of the VESTIGE survey, we used H$\alpha$ images to select ETGs that show no signs of ongoing star formation. We combined VESTIGE with images from Astrosat/UVIT, GALEX and CFHT from the NGVS to analyse radial spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the FUV to the NIR. The UV emission in these galaxies is likely due to old, low mass stars in post main sequence (PMS) phases, the UV upturn. We fit the radial SEDs with novel SP models that include an old, hot stellar component of PMS stars with various temperatures and energetics. This way, we explore the main stellar parameters responsible for UV upturn stars irregardless of their evolutionary path. Standard models are not able to reproduce the galaxies' central FUV emission (SMA/$R_{eff}\lesssim1$), while the new models well characterise it through PMS stars with temperatures T$\gtrsim$25000 K. All galaxies are old (mass-weighted ages $\gtrsim10$ Gyr) and the most massive M49 and M87 are supersolar within SMA/$R_{\rm eff}\lesssim0.2$. Overall, we found flat age gradients ($\nabla$Log(Age)$\sim -0.04 - 0$ dex) and shallow metallicity gradients ($\nabla$Log(Z)$<-0.2$ dex), except for M87 ($\nabla$Log($Z_{\rm M87}$)$\simeq-0.45$ dex). Our results show that these ETGs formed with timescales $\tau\lesssim1500$ Myr, having assembled between $\sim40-90\%$ of their stellar mass at $z\sim5$. This is consistent with recent JWST observations of quiescent massive galaxies at high$-z$, which are likely the ancestors of the largest ETGs in the nearby Universe. The derived flat/shallow gradients indicate that major mergers might have contributed to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.
